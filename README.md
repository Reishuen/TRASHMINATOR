## PROCESS ðŸ¤”
1. The video is uploaded either by the user or taken from other sources like security cameras
2. The video is then scanned to detect the amount of trash 
3. The location is marked on a map and shown to the users who can then volunteer to help clean up the location
4. The users will in turn receive points for helping out and there is also a leaderboard which encourages users to clean up more
