## PROCESS ðŸ¤”
Here's how it works: users can upload their own videos or source them from security cameras, which are then scanned to identify the amount of trash present. This location is marked on a map and made available to users who can volunteer to help clean it up. In return for their efforts, these users will earn points and rise up the leaderboard, inspiring them to keep making a positive impact on their community. It's a simple but powerful way to promote environmental responsibility and make a real difference.
